# Postgres playground

This just contains some scratchpads and learnings about Postgres. Don't bother too much with the code. If anything, it's more the notes.

## Topics

- [permissions](./permissions/readme.md) for some stuff I learnt about the permission model
- [transactions](./transactions/readme.md) for some stuff I learnt about the transactions, savepoints and such.
- [replication](./replication/readme.md) for how to set up logical replication and some shower thoughts about version upgrade strategies.
- [byteas](./byteas/notes.md) for some VERY rough notes on some experiments I did with the bytea type.
